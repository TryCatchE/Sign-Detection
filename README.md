Hand Gesture Recognition System
This project is a real-time hand gesture recognition system using Python and various libraries such as OpenCV, MediaPipe, and scikit-learn.

Description
The system can recognize hand gestures captured through a webcam and perform actions based on the recognized gestures. It utilizes machine learning models to predict gestures, allowing for interactions such as typing letters, controlling applications, and issuing commands through hand gestures.

Features
Real-time hand gesture recognition
Support for single and double hand gestures
Recognition of predefined gestures for letters, words, and commands
Dynamic display of recognized gestures and actions
